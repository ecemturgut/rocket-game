If u dowload the zip file and open in Unity you need to load the scene.If you manage to open up your downloaded Unity project and immediately hit Play without much thought, you may find that your scene doesnâ€™t show anything.
This is because Unity automatically loads up a temporary Untitled scene during the opening of a project.On the top left side click "file" then click "open scene" .Click on "Scenes" folder then open the "over" scene.
First scene is the first level which is named "over" and second level is the scene called "under".

How to play:
Use 'A' and 'D' key on your computer to rotate the rocket and press 'Space' to accelerate/power up your rocket.
Main goal is to cross and land on the green platform without hitting the obstacles on the way.
If you land on the green platform it lets you play the second level.If you fail you go back to the beginning.
